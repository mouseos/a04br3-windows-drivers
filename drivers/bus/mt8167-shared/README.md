# MT8167 shared resources

`pwrap_owner` serializes a narrow MT6392 button-status transaction through a
parent-supplied blocking lock. It enforces stop and preserves timeout poison;
it does not publish an interface or claim resources. A real Windows PnP parent
must exclusively own/map PWRAP, initialize and retain the lock and power,
manage client references and teardown, and stop firmware/other drivers from
bypassing it. The existing button WDF provider still maps PWRAP itself; do not
run a separate owner concurrently. Clock ownership, shared clock leases,
rate arbitration and PMIC audio writes are not implemented.

The button core offers an explicit shared callback path. When selected, a
missing callback fails and cannot fall back to direct access. It is not wired
to Windows PnP. Legacy direct access remains unchanged until a real parent
and a verified migration can be deployed together.
